      extensive resume, because the app learns about you and proposes solutions
      itself. You only get a few offers perfectly tailored to your needs. Then

      Intelligence</strong> will draw conclusions and provide you with different
      ones - this is how it gets to know you!"

about:
  title: By downloading hiree you support the recruitment revolution
  paragraphs:
  - text: When creating hiree, we came to the conclusion that nothing has changed <strong>in recruitment in the past 100 years</strong>. We have entered the digital age, but we are still dealing with advertising columns and newspaper-style job ads – the only difference is it’s online.
  - text: "<strong>The recruitment methods tend to favor quantity over quality</strong> and the job interview experience is rough and unpleasant. Nobody pays you for the time spent in the recruitment process. <strong>You are often judged by the looks of your resume</strong> rather than by your qualifications, skills and experience. <strong>Resumes have become colorful gimmicks</strong> showcasing creativity and ingenuity."
  - text: Worse still, too many job search sites ask you to fill out exactly the same details in online forms anyway. <strong>You don’t know where did your resume get stuck on its journey</strong>, there is no salary information, and you are left high and dry.<br><strong>Sounds familiar?</strong>
