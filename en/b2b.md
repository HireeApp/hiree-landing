Moreover, you do not have to deal with long resumes - we gather only the most crucial information on both sides. In addition, your salary range is known only to AI which will match candidates accordingly.

        paragraph: After posting a job advertisement you will immediately receive first candidate recommendations. Those selected by hiree are already shortlisted and it is for you to decide on the next steps. If you want you can immediately invite them to the next round of the hiring process. If they are matched with your advertisement it means they are interested in the position.
